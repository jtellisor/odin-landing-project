<p>Time for the next project, where I will build a website from scratch!</p>
<p>I am going to imagine this will be quite painful.</p>

<p>This was quite fun to make! It took a while to get started, but once it began it never stopped!</p>
<p> The css is quite long, however. So I want ot get better about getting the same -- or better -- results with less lines of text.</p>
<p>But learning the solutions to questions and topics we have not covered yet is so rewarding!</p>
<Also still getting use to the flexbox, but it is getting there! I would say I am much more than from last week! Never thought I would have fun with this coding business.</p>
<p>Can't yet for the next lesson!</p>
